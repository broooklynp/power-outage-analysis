# Analysis of Major Power Outages in the U.S.

by Brooklyn Pagaza

## Introduction

The dataset used for this analysis contains data about major power outages that occurred in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. It includes one row for every observed major power outage, and contains information for each outage including the location, cause, date, and duration of the outage. In this analysis, I will be exploring the question: Which characteristics are associated with power outages in different regions of the U.S.?

Knowing about the causes of power outages across the United States can help citizens and the government decrease the likelihood of power outages occurring in the future. If there are observable patterns that point to a power outage occurring, action can be taken ahead of time to prevent a major power outage. Importantly, the characteristics that correspond with a major power outage might be different in different regions of the U.S. due to factors like weather, geography, or population, so it is important to understand those trends in order to be prepared. Since power is so essential to our lives today, it makes sense that we should use the information available to try to prevent major power outages.

The raw dataset used for this analysis contains 1534 rows
